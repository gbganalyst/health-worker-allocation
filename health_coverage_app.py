# #     #### What is Health Workforce Density?
# #     Health Workforce Density means the number of healthcare workers (like doctors, nurses, and midwives) available to take care of people in a given area. It's measured by counting how many of these workers are available for every 10,000 people in the population.

# #     #### Why is it Important?
# #     Imagine you're in a town, and there are only a few doctors, nurses, and midwives available. If many people get sick at the same time, there won't be enough healthcare workers to take care of everyone quickly and effectively. Having an adequate number of healthcare workers ensures that people can get medical help when they need it, without long waits or shortages.

# #     #### How is it Measured?
# #     We look at how many doctors, nurses, and midwives there are for every 10,000 people. This gives us a good idea of whether there are enough healthcare workers to meet the needs of the community.

# #     #### WHO Recommendations
# #     The World Health Organization (WHO) gives us some guidelines on the minimum number of healthcare workers needed to ensure good healthcare services:

# #     Doctors: At least 1 doctor for every 1,000 people. This means for every 10,000 people, there should be at least 10 doctors.
# #     Nurses: At least 3 nurses for every 1,000 people. So, for every 10,000 people, there should be at least 30 nurses.
   
# #     #### Overall Health Workers:
# #     To achieve good healthcare coverage, there should be at least 44.5 health workers (including doctors and nurses) for every 10,000 people.
